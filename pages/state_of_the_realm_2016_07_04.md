### People

The British people voted by a clear majority to leave the European Union{% fact 1 %}.  The alignment of age and other constituencies
were starker than recent general elections{% statement 2 %}.

Highlights from Lord Ashcroft's Poll{% fact 3 %}:

+ _Age is strongly correlated: those under 45 voted remain_
+ _University education was a slightly less so, for remain (58%)_
+ _Self-described Christians voted 58% to leave_
+ _30% of Liberal Democrats and 25% of Greens wanted to leave_
+ _Time of making decision was approximately equal between sides_
+ _Top reason for remain (43%) was risk to economy, jobs and prices_
+ _Second (31%) was "access to the EU single market without Schengen or the euro"_
+ _Main reason for leaving (49%) was national sovereignty_
+ _Second (33%) was control of immigration_
+ _9% of remain voters' main reason was a "strong attachment to the EU and its shared history, culture and traditions"_
+ _The strongest difference in broad social attitudes is remain voters believing life to be better than 30 years ago, and leave voters the opposite_


### Parliament

Following the referendum, both major parties are in a state of upheaval{% statement 4 %}.  The likely Conservative candidates for leader of the party, and therefore Prime Minister, are (as of now) Mrs May with 117 declared backers and Mrs Leadsom on 38, trailed by Mr Gove (26), Mr Crabb (22), and Mr Fox (7){% fact 5 %}.  There have been rumours of tactical voting to favour Mr Crabb, in order to present a Remain-Remain choice to the wider Conservative Party members &mdash; a worry which is mirrored in the discrepancy between the Parliamentary Labour Party and its member base in support of the current leader{% fact 6 %}.  The trinity of PLP, membership and voting public is strongly divided, and even from a completely pragmatic angle, it is unclear how much support Mr Corbyn as leader could hope to bring to the primary party of the Opposition in the event of a General Election.

The two parties have essentially failed to mirror a fundamental division on society into the sides taken on the referendum{% conjecture 7 %} {% inference s2 f6 %}.  Will we see a realignment along these lines?  Of particular note is the strong (and historic) remain position declared by the Liberal Democrats in the aftermath{% fact 8 %}, and the invitation by the Green party leadership to main opposition parties to organize together for this single issue{% fact 9 %}.

### Treasury

Following on-the-day volatility, equity indices have returned to their approximate pre-vote value{% fact 10 %}.  Sterling remains fairly constant
about 11% below its Thursday value against the USD{% fact 11 %}.  Medium to long term economic impact will depend greatly on the future trading relationship between the UK and Common Market states{% conjecture 12 %}.

### Realm

Mrs Sturgeon's quick call for another Scottish independence referendum{% fact 13 %}, and visit to Europe for preserving Scotland's economic
relationship with the EU are justified by the Scottish peoples clear (62%) desire to remain, however the economic case for
independence is considerably weakened{% conjecture 14 %} by low oil prices{% fact 15 %}.  In post-referendum polls a lead of between 3 and 7 percent said they would vote for independence{% fact 16 %}.  Henry the Fifth now seems prescient{% footnote 17 %}:

>
We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,<br>
But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,<br>
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:<br>
For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather<br>
__Neuer went with his forces into France,__<br>
__But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,__<br>
Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,<br>
With ample and brim fulnesse of his force,<br>
Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,<br>
Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:<br>
That England being emptie of defence,<br>
Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood<br>

An event that would further impact the national mood {% inference s4 c7 f16 %} would be the passing of Her Majesty the Queen, an event with greater that approximately one-in-four odds{% fact 18 %} in the two-year horizon.

  _"For many millions of people, this was not just a vote about Europe. It was a howl of anger at politicians and institutions who they felt they were out of touch and had let them down."_

  _"The British people deserve the chance not to be stuck with the appalling consequences of a Leave campaign that stoked that anger with the lies of Farage, Johnson and Gove."_

  _"The Liberal Democrats will fight the next election on a clear promise to restore British prosperity and role in the world, with the UK in the European Union, not out."_
