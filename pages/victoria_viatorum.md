_A visitor’s experience of Victoria Square, an important intermediate destination for migrants on their way to Western Europe and microcosm of the situation for the Greeks and their foreign temporary residents &mdash; March, 2016_


I first met her on Friday, when she accused me of being able to speak her language.

‘You speak Greek! I heard you at the kiosk.’

She thought I was ignoring her: a problem she faced a lot, dressed the cast-off T-shirt, long grey hair swept back, standing with her shabby boxes in Victoria Square, Athens at 2 in the morning.  But my Greek, like that of most people in this dirty quad, comprised just a few words learnt since I arrived here several weeks ago.

Victoria Square.  The focal point of Europe, ‘symbolic of the endeavour, hope and determination that has spurred the continent’s biggest migration of people since the second world war,’ the British newspaper had read days before, ‘If you go to Iran, you’ll hear people speak about Victoria Square.’  Living in such a place, we’re on one hand in the everyday — café hellenico from the Albanian–Greek coffee shop, oranges from the left-wing greengrocer, souvlaki from the Romanian–Greek in that small, quiet place across the square.  The chairs arrayed outside tavernas and restaurants, ready for the European tourists, the life-blood of modern Greece, now vacant.  One hundred empty chairs and a hundred people sitting on the ground, ‘nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down,’ except that many of the young men’s phones are bigger and more expensive than my own, and food is periodically distributed by patchwork charities and the more public-spirited Athenians.  On the other hand, we inhabit a different sphere, where you spot yourself eating pork souvlaki in the background of the live news broadcast, and awake every morning as almost a voyeur in the story of the decade.

‘Look at these people,’ she said.  ‘Misery.  This is Greece today.’  M studied in England in her youth, and was a film director.  She talks quickly and is always looking around.  Her first love was Budapest, her film and photographs were stolen in Czechoslovakia, she tells me.  Bending over, she examines a piece of clothing left on the ground in this chaos of bodies, then picks it up, satisfied there is further life left in it.  ‘When they go they just leave their things here.  They don’t care about the next people.  That’s the one thing that makes me angry about them.’  I think about the people of my country and how they’d act if they found themselves in this situation, and feel that we humans aren’t all that different.  She’ll take all these boxes of clothes home, wash them, then bring them back for the new wave of refugees that everyone knows will appear tomorrow, as has happened month after month, with no end in sight.  I’m instructed to go to the protest tomorrow outside the Austrian embassy.  The Austrians closed their border days before, and the dream of European free travel is disintegrating.  I’m also pledged to attend a film society screening on Sunday evening — ‘you won’t know the words, but you’ll understand’.  As I’m leaving she points out the man with the shaved head standing with three cops on the corner: ‘he’s a Nazi.’

‘I find it hard to know what to think,’ the shopkeeper on the square tells me.  ‘I’m a Christian and so am supposed to love them.’  He imitates slapping his cheek, ‘but they have destroyed me.’  He’s moving somewhere else in the city where maybe enough of the already suffering Greeks and affluent tourists will still buy his stuff.  ‘Lots of reporters come to the square.  They film, and ask for stories.  But no one asks for mine.’  I decide to write this piece, and tell him I’ll send a copy.

The Catholic Hungarians don’t want Muslims in their country.  ‘Are you in favour of the EU being allowed to make the settlement of non-Hungarians obligatory in Hungary, even if the Parliament does not agree?’ the Hungarian people are being asked right now.  My people are being asked: ‘Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?’  Existing tensions in the continent and in its historically new political union are under enormous stress from an issue seen variously as a moral test or as a civilisational peril.  Greece is particularly ill-suited to bear the brunt of the crisis, still suffering deeply the effects of the near decade-old financial collapse.  Disillusionment with the Tsipras government is widespread among the young people, no longer because it hasn’t achieved a solution, but because it’s thought there is no solution.  None of these travellers want to stay here — they want to be in the gold-paved streets of Germany or milk-and-honey England — but people begin to say that Macedonia has closed her border.

Donated meat lays uneaten because nobody knows whether it’s halal — this is no home, where even the food is viewed with suspicion.  When they reach their destination, what will they think of the cold North Europeans?  We hear that Turkey is sending her jets daily over the disputed islands, forcing Greece to scramble hers.  Old people here used to drink τούρκικος — Turkish coffee, but now everyone drinks ελληνικός — Greek: the drink is the same, but it’s been rebranded.

The volunteers of VluchtelingenWerk Nederland, armed with reflective jackets and backpacks full of plastic-wrapped women’s tights, speak Dutch and English.  I meet a British lady with Arabic and Farsi, but she found volunteering as a translator at the port of Piraeus ‘just too chaotic’.  The Salvation Army are here too, and communication at times breaks down, like in real armies.  Here it sinks to clumsy gesticulation: raise your hand to your mouth and you get the idea of eating across to pretty much anybody.  The common reality of our physical needs encourages me for a bit.  A nearby chain coffee shop is happy to deal with the lavatorial needs of women and children — a hand on the bladder — and this is where they are directed.  But they don’t want the men.

I go in to sit with my laptop at the window bar, and am joined by a man who sits close on my right.  He messages on his phone in Arabic — maybe a friend who’s made it across the last few borders, maybe his family, maybe a lover.  I think of the girl I love.  A young woman with low-cut top and sequin skirt sits on my left and runs a smooth hand through her hair.  I wonder if she’s selling something.  Or maybe the game is that Mademoiselle gets talking to the gentleman while he’s relieved of all unwanted possessions by the man who gazes right now, so disinterestedly at his phone.  I get uncomfortable and leave.

A man walks out in front of a car with a bundle of Khat, the mildly addictive plant you chew to cure excessive productivity.  Does he know this is illegal in London?  A lady driver stops, gets out, and opens the back of her car.  She is surrounded immediately by the assertive and the enterprising, and hands out food to the young men who are always at the front.  The game here is to get something, which is fast stashed at one’s back, or thrown to a friend, and at once try for another.  The old men and women gaze on forlornly; I go home.

I arrive late to the cinema, a small door leading to a single room one street down from the square, and catch the end of Tornatore’s Cinema Paradiso (Italian, Greek subtitles) followed by critical discussion (Greek, no subtitles).  M wasn’t there.  The film feels at best tangentially relevant to the situation: an Italian film director remembering his youth, with the end kissing compilation scene — the pent-up release of human spirit.  The word featuring most in the end discussion was nostalgia (hard g).  Nostalgia for the good times.  Nostalgia for German holidaymakers and German buyers of sovereign debt.

M is waiting for me outside, around the corner.  She introduces me to the two men she has captured for the moment: an artist and a tall Romanian man, with whom I’m urged to speak in English.  He is shy and tries to slope away, away from her hold.

‘Run after him!  He is old and can only walk.’

‘I can’t, M.’

Her voice is forced and thin.  She says she hasn’t slept since I met her three nights ago, but she seems completely undiminished in essence.  I’ll help tonight.

We walk around, picking up clothes and food and talking to the refugees.  Some of them think she’s crazy and tell me so, but others are grateful for her redistributive efforts.  She knows where different families sit, and what they need: two girls want new tights, an old man is hungry, the toddler needs milk.  Sometimes we have to guard her trolley and the dirty boxes, ‘the one with the red hat is a thief.’  Her eyesight is bad, and she needs me to pick out edible food and clothes that aren’t too badly soiled.  We make our way slowly around the square.

Hitting your children is illegal in Greece, and the police will take them away along with your wife if it’s reported, no matter the standing of the person who reports it.  One Afghan family know this and are scared of M for this reason.  ‘The father hits the children.’  An older boy stands with a narrow stick, the rest of them sitting in a circle of baggage and thick blankets.  M picks up a football and rolls it to one of the girls who kicks it back.  Her brother reflexively swats her leg and pulls her back into the fold.  She takes the stick, breaks it in half, and goes to talk with the mother.  She bows down deeply to her with hands together, a gesture she says is appropriate and will be understood as a sign of female solidarity.  Her feminism is foreign and feels ridiculous in this present moment.  A crowd forms around her, and she declares that I’m her husband.  The crowd becomes wary, but somewhat suspicious of the decades age-gap between me and this eccentric woman.  Eventually the family get up, wrap their belongings in blankets, and leave to escape M, who is fine except for a bleeding arm from somebody’s nails.

‘Will the father hit her again?’ she asks.

‘Yes.’

‘I don’t think the mother will any more.’

We continue around the square to a bench with two fat Greek men on it.  M introduces me to one, and it’s while I’m shaking his hand that I see the crystal-studded belt and the young Afghan boy.  He holds the small hand in his larger one, stroking it.
‘They pay 5 euros to fuck,’ explains M.

Her swearing feels purposeful and political.  In her youth vulgarity was probably a form of dissent, and this is the way she uses it today, devoid of the crassness it carries back home.  Athens is ‘shit’.  The police are ‘shits’.  The old man sleeping in the doorway had cancer and has a bag tied to his leg, ‘from his intestines.’

‘Colostomy?’

‘Yes,’ agrees M, ‘shit.’

After hours in the square, M has lost all strength.  We slowly gather the assorted clothes and detritus together, strapped in boxes to the trolley, or in large reinforced bags with polythene wrapped around the handles to stop them cutting into our hands.  We leave the square, charity workers gone home, families asleep under blankets, young men still standing there smoking, the Algerian local with his dog talking to the older Greek woman who M says is going to prove herself by getting a younger man, the policemen on the corner leaning on their riot shields for which I could imagine no possible use.

Dragging everything from Victoria to the anti-authoritarian area of Exarcheia, she points at buildings telling me when they were built and who lives there.  This is where she was born, and she know this area like nobody else I meet.  The people sitting in Exarcheia Square drinking beer and smoking marijuana, unmolested by the Greek police, were not the ‘true Exarcheia’ of her past.  Maybe the squatters in the former local tax office are closer to the mark.

Occasionally, her trolley falls over and the boxes full of clothes and paraphernalia spills onto the street.  Taxis slow down hopefully, then speed away when they can make us out properly.  ’M,’ I said, ‘we look ridiculous with all this stuff.’

‘Say it again!’

‘We look ridiculous with all this stuff!’

Past the Athens Connections 3X Hotel — ‘good for: short stays’ on TripAdvisor.  She tells me a story of her and a boyfriend going there for sex and escaping via the roof, down the fire escape of an adjacent building, in some past time.  On some streets I’m told to stick to the middle to evade the wall-mounted cameras.  ‘We look ridiculous,’ I was made to say again.

Approaching her apartment, we maintain compete silence.  ‘Don’t talk to any Greek men,’ she says, ‘unless I introduce you.’  M has names for every stray cat and talks to them as people.  This is the first time I wonder what I’m doing carrying all this worthless stuff across Athens with this lady who everyone else thinks is crazy.  ‘I have to stop going back to the Square,’ she admonishes herself, stopping for a moment to survey our progress, ‘this is crazy.’

She swings open the heavy glass door of her apartment lobby and I hold it motionlessly ajar with my foot.  Any movement produces a loud squeaking sound and my job is to remain still while M carries box after box in.  I get the feeling that the relationship between her and her neighbours might not be without its frustrations, boxes of rubbish lining the corridor inside.  I also wonder how many of these clothes will actually end up laundered and back in Victoria.  A garbage truck pulls up across the street and she darts into the shadows — she has some sort of long-running feud with the Athens refuse service.  I stand there stupidly, all my human faculties reduced to my weight against the door.  I take out my phone and pretend to call someone.  The men still stare at me.

I think of the Russians and the temporary ceasefire, the people of Greece and their hospitality to the people landing on their beaches, Queen Victoria and her station in this old city, Oedipus wandering homeless around Greece, and M awake in the early hours of Monday morning, unable to carry on from tiredness.  There is no victory here, only mitigation and compromise at the edge of Europe.
